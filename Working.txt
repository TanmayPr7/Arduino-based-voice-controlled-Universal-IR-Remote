# This the Arduino based Universal remote system which is controlled by users voice,
it uses a microcontroller, tsop Ir reciver, ir led(transmitter), bluetooth module, resistor
, etc.Firstly with the help of tsop Ir reciver and Arduino nano we will decode Ir hexa
decimal code of any other Ir controller device and save it.

# We will basically use these hexa decimal code which we have recived befor, in our main
source code.It basically opreates with Hc 05 bluetooth module which is connected to our
main device. It will get connected with android from which you want to give voice commands
to remote, according to source code it will recive voice command from android and recognize it
then it will work according to source code and according to source code, it will transmit 
IR hexa decimal value with the help of Ir led(Transmitter). And then it will work as our basic 
Ir remote.

# This is the basic working of our voice controlled Universal Ir remote Project:)
